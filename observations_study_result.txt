1. Observation is based on tumor volume growth rate in mm3. Based on the pivot table, we started with same size tumor volume.
After given the medication, we can see based on the time point that Capomulin is the strongest drug to suppressed the growth of the tumor. 
The other 3 drugs that we observed didn't slow down the tumor growth rate at all. 

2. We also make observation based on the metastatic spread during the treatment. 
Even though in the previous Tumor volume observation that Capomulin able to suppress the growth of the tumor; 
However, the metastatic graph say otherwise because the tumor will still spread to other part of the body but in a slower rate than the other drugs tested. 

3. Each experiment are started with 25 mice based on the 2 previous graph, we can already see that the mice treated with Capomulin will have higher chance to slow down the growth rate of the tumor. 
We can confirmed our conclusion from the summary bar graph. Capomulin has 19% chance to slow down the growth rate of the tumor. 
Meanwhile, the other 3 drugs that we observed, Ketapril happen to be the most non effective to help slow down the tumor growth rate.
